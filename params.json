{"name":"Gondola","tagline":"Navigate docker world easily.","body":"# Gondola\r\n\r\n  Gondola is a docker ui for docker hosts. It lets you view your local containers,\r\nimages and system information. It allows you to drill down deep into docker image\r\nhistory, how much space you are using and the steps used to construct the\r\nDockerfile.\r\n\r\n![Gif]\r\n(http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/9-15-2015/ijCdBT.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n  You can run this in your docker host by using the command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   docker run -v \\\r\n    /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\r\n    -p 59292:8080 kunday/gondola:3\r\n```\r\n  You should now be able to reach the ui through the `hostip:59292` address. By\r\ndefault, if your machine is accessible to the world, this will be accessible to\r\nthe world too, if you have any sensitive information in your docker history it's\r\nrecommended to block access in usual way.\r\n\r\n## Setting up for development\r\n\r\nCheckout the project from github using:\r\n\r\n\tgit checkout https://github.com/kunday/gondola.git\r\n\r\nCompile a version of the application locally by running\r\n\r\n\tmake\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, start a local version using:\r\n\r\n    docker-compose up\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n\r\n\r\n#TODO\r\n1. Enable meta screen showing the connection options\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
